Team work app on Android
This app aims at giving all Geekskool students a way to assign tasks to each other and communicate on the progress of those
tasks. The "Add Task" screen allows a student/mentor to assign a task to a Geekskool member. Tasks cannot be assigned to
non-members. The "Existing Tasks" screen allows people to see the tasks that they created or were assigned. When one of the
tasks is selected, the user is taken to the "Comments" screen where they can chat with the creator/assignee on the progress of
the task.
The project uses Firebase as a backend and needs an active internet connection to function.
